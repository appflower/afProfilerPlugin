afProfilerPlugin

Thanks to this plugin you can profile AppFlower applications.
We are using HttpKernel and HttpFoundation symfony2 components here.
Profiler is plugged into sf1.4 processing flow.

It collects data regarding all requests.
There is a token generated and injected into response headers.

In order to use this plugin you need to place it under plugins/afProfilerPlugin dir
and modify your filters.yml file.
You need to configure afProfilerPlugin specific filter in filters.yml file:

rendering: ~
profiling:
  class: afProfilerFilter
  file: %SF_ROOT_DIR%/plugins/afProfilerPlugin/lib/filter/afProfilerFilter.php
security:  ~
...

And there is second filter that needs to be used but this one you can enable only
by editing appFlowerPlugin/config/config.php file
At the end of this file you should a line like this one:

sfConfig::set('sf_execution_filter', array('afExecutionFilter', array('execution')));

change it to:

sfConfig::set('sf_execution_filter', array('afProfilerExecutionFilter', array('execution')));



You may also need to init and update git submodules:
git submodule init
git submodule update
