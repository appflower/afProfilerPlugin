afProfilerPlugin

Thanks to this plugin you can profile AppFlower applications.
We are using HttpKernel and HttpFoundation symfony2 components here.
Profiler is plugged into sf1.4 processing flow.

It collects data regarding all requests.
There is a token generated and injected into response headers.


In order to use this plugin you need to modify your filters.yml file.
We need to put afProfilerFilter at the beginning of filter chain:

profiling:
  class: afProfilerFilter

rendering: ~
security:  ~
