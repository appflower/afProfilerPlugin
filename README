afProfilerPlugin

Thanks to this plugin you can profile AppFlower applications.
We are using HttpKernel and HttpFoundation symfony2 components here.
Profiler is plugged into sf1.4 processing flow.

It collects data regarding all requests.
There is a token generated and injected into response headers.


In order to use this plugin you need to place it under plugins/afProfilerPlugin dir
and modify your filters.yml file.
We need to put afProfilerFilter right after rendering filter in filters chain:

rendering: ~
profiling:
  class: afProfilerFilter
  file: %SF_ROOT_DIR%/plugins/afProfilerPlugin/lib/filter/afProfilerFilter.php
security:  ~
...

Note that there is also afProfilerExecutionFilter used but it is defined in filters.yml


You may also need to init and update git submodules:
git submodule init
git submodule update


TODO:
* implement widgets that lists logged requests and shows it's detailed informations
* provide possibility to show diff between two requests
